            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><b>T</b>he Taj Mahal, a timeless symbol of love and architectural brilliance, stands majestically on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, India. Commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal is a marvel that transcends the boundaries of time and captivates the hearts of millions.

                Completed in 1653, the Taj Mahal is renowned for its breathtaking beauty and has earned its place as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The monument's allure lies not only in its stunning architecture but also in the profound love story that inspired its creation.</p>

            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>The architecture of the Taj Mahal is a testament to the Mughal dynasty's unparalleled craftsmanship and artistic finesse. Designed by the architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the monument seamlessly blends Persian, Ottoman, Indian, and Islamic architectural styles. The central focus is the white marble mausoleum, a masterpiece of symmetry and precision.

                The main dome, crowned by a golden finial, stands as the pinnacle of the Taj Mahal's grandeur. Four minarets, elegantly positioned at each corner of the plinth, add to the symmetry and serve both aesthetic and structural purposes. The intricate marble inlay work, featuring delicate floral patterns and calligraphy from the Quran, showcases the artisans' unparalleled skill.
                
                The charbagh, a Persian-style garden, surrounds the mausoleum, further enhancing the overall harmony of the architectural design. The reflection pools on either side of the central pathway create a mesmerizing mirror image, adding a touch of ethereal beauty to the monument.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The history of the Taj Mahal is steeped in romance and tragedy. Emperor Shah Jahan, grief-stricken by the death of his favorite wife Mumtaz Mahal during childbirth, vowed to build a monument that would immortalize their love. The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and took over 20 years to complete.

                The Taj Mahal was more than just a mausoleum; it was a grand expression of Shah Jahan's love and a symbol of eternal devotion. The emperor spared no expense, employing artisans and craftsmen from across the empire to create a structure that would stand the test of time.
                
                Today, the Taj Mahal stands as a testament to the enduring power of love and the genius of Mughal architecture. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it continues to draw millions of visitors from around the world who come to witness its unparalleled beauty and immerse themselves in the romantic tale that gave birth to this architectural marvel.</p>
